The lab5 package is connected with the datascience toolkit API to convert location and coordination by two function:
  
  
- geocode_func
- rgeocode_func

**package httr and json is required to be installed** 
  
###Functions
####geocode_func
  
The 'geocode_func'class retrive the coordinates of a given address.The funtion uses the datascience toolkit API to retrieve the result.

For a single address we use the single_adr method that takes as input a character string and returns a data frame with the address
and the requested coordinates.

For multiple addresses we use the mult_adr method that as input requires a data frame of addresses and returns a data frame of the addresses and the requested coordinates.
